I am Anirudh from [Chennai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai), pursuing my postgraduate studies in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in) at the [Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in). I am associated with the [PACE Lab](https://pace.cse.iitm.ac.in) where I conduct my research under the guidance of Professor [Rupesh Nasre](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~rupesh). My interests revolve around scalable and high-performance computing.

Previously, I completed my bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science from [SSN College of Engineering](https://www.ssn.edu.in) and worked as a Software Engineer at [Everstage Technologies](https://www.everstage.com). I have contributed to multiple projects involving data processing pipelines, ETL workflows, and integrations with external applications.

Beyond my academic activities, I am a cricket enthusiast with a love for [cinema](https://app.tvtime.com/profile/66255332) and [music](https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCeicZvVUsrWlWfSShb-70Dw) spanning different genres. In my free time, I explore the cultural and intellectual heritage of [Bharat](https://iksindia.org) with a modern outlook. I also enjoy cooking and experimenting with a variety of recipes and culinary techniques.
