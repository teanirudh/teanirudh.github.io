```c++
cout << "Hello World" << endl;
```

I am Anirudh from Chennai, pursuing my postgraduate degree in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/) at the [Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/). I am associated with the [PACE Lab](https://pace.cse.iitm.ac.in/) where I conduct my research under the guidance of Professor [Rupesh Nasre](https://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~rupesh/). My interests revolve around scalable and high-performance computing.

Previously, I completed my bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science from [SSN College of Engineering](https://www.ssn.edu.in/) and worked as a Software Engineer at [Everstage Technologies](https://www.everstage.com/). I have contributed to projects involving data pipelines, ETL workflows, and integrations with external applications.

Outside academia, I am a cricket enthusiast with a love for cinema and music across various genres. In my free time, I enjoy cooking and experimenting with new recipes. I also greatly value Bharatiya Knowledge Systems and actively explore them. Feel free to connect if you share similar interests!
